      "V Move You was built on a single idea: sending a large file to another human should not require an account, a credit card or a download client. You drop your files, you get a link, you share it. That's it.",
      "Behind the simple front door is a serious pipeline. Every transfer is uploaded in resumable chunks straight to V Move You's edge storage, so a flaky coffee-shop Wi-Fi connection won't cost you a 9 GB re-upload. Each link is unique, expirable and revocable from your browser.",
      "We give every visitor 10 GB per transfer for free — five times what most legacy tools offer on their free tier — and we don't gate downloads behind ads, banners or signup walls. Recipients click, they get the file.",

      "Most file-sharing tools have quietly become subscription funnels. The free tier shrinks, the ads grow, the recipient experience gets worse. We wanted to flip that.",
      "V Move You is sponsored by V Move You — the platform that powers our infrastructure. That sponsorship is the entire business model. No upsells inside the product, no dark patterns, no email harvesting. The V Move You panel you see while uploading is the ad — that is what keeps the lights on.",
      "If you like what V Move You does, click through. If you don't, just send your file. Both work.",

      "Compress smart. ZIP is universal but slow; for media-heavy folders, 7z or tar.zst usually wins. Skip compression entirely for already-compressed formats (MP4, JPG, PDF) — you'll save CPU time with no size benefit.",
      "Group by recipient, not by topic. One link per person beats one link with eight files and a confused recipient. V Move You lets you set a title and a short message per transfer to keep context attached.",
      "Always include a sender email. It's optional, but it lets the recipient reply if a file is corrupted or out of date.",
      "If you're sending sensitive material, share the link over a different channel than the password. Don't put both in the same email.",

      "When you upload a 10 GB file, V Move You doesn't send it as one giant HTTP request. It's split into chunks (typically 6 MB each), uploaded in parallel, and reassembled on the server.",
      "Each chunk's progress is tracked locally in your browser. If your connection drops, only the in-flight chunks need to be retried — not the entire transfer. When you reopen the tab, the upload picks up where it left off.",
      "This is the same protocol (tus) used by professional video pipelines. We use it because it's the only honest way to ship 10 GB over a real-world internet connection.",

    body: [
      "Your files travel over TLS from your browser to our edge, and they sit at rest encrypted on the storage layer. Share links are random 12-character codes, so they're effectively unguessable.",
      "We don't scan the content of your transfers, we don't index them, and we don't sell them. We log standard request metadata (timestamps, sizes, IPs) for abuse prevention and we expire it on a schedule.",
      "If you need stronger guarantees — end-to-end encryption, expiring passwords, audit trails — the V Move You platform offers them for teams. V Move You remains the free, no-account front door.",
